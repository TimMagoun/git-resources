# Resources for Git and GitHub
## Note
If you are already familiar with git, please use whichever client you are most comfortable with.

## Why Git?
- Keep track of changes you've made to your code.
- Go back to previous versions of your code.
- Work on different versions or features independently and easily merge them together.
- Work on the same code collaboratively, with others.
- Widely used (74% of surveyed) by companies and research labs around the world!

Git is a version control system that keeps track of your changes over time. We will use it to share code between you and your TA, as well as help code organization.

## What You Should Be Able to Do:
1. Create a repository on your MIT GitHub (https://github.mit.edu)
2. **Clone** that repository to your computer
3. **Stage** and **commit** changes made to your code
4. Undo commits and edits if necessary using **revert**
5. **Push** the commits to your MIT GitHub
6. Rinse and repeat steps 3-5

## Other useful things
1. Create different branches and use **checkout** to switch between them
2. Using **merge** to combine changes from different sources
3. Using **stash** to temporarily discard changes
